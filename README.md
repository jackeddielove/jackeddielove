# About me

I have a PhD in math, an MDes in interaction design, and over a decade of experience in various teaching, leadership, and design roles.

I love the magic that happens when we are engaged with ourselves and our world as creators in a creative place.

Right now I am interested in medicine men and women, clairvoyants, intuitives, seers, energy healers, etc., and the implications of mainstream Western culture's denial of them.
